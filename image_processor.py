Image Processing Program for Beginners
=====================================

This program teaches you how to:
1. Load and work with images in Python
2. Apply different types of image effects (blur, mosaic)
3. Understand what happens to images when we process them
4. Use statistics to measure image changes
5. Save your processed images

What is an Image?
-----------------
An image is just a grid of numbers! Each number represents how bright a pixel is:
- 0 = completely black
- 255 = completely white  
- Numbers in between = different shades of gray

What is a Histogram?
--------------------
A histogram shows how many pixels have each brightness level.
It's like counting how many dark pixels vs light pixels you have.

What is Statistical Testing?
---------------------------
Statistical tests help us answer: "Did our image processing actually change the image?"
We use math to measure if the changes are real or just random.
